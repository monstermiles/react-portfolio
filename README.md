      ## Description:
      This is a coding portfolio made using React and AntDesign.  It has an "About Me" page, a portfolio of some of my coding projects, a link to download a copy of my resume, and a contact page. The contact page isnt fully functional... yet.

      This project is not deployed.  Even with help from the professor and TAs, I have no idea why I cant get it deployed to GitHub Pages or Heroku.  I've tried everything I can think of, includign starting a new repo several times. Sorry.
